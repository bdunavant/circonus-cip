# Circonus Instrumentation Packs

This project is an effort to make the easy process of submitting telemetry data to Circonus even easier!

Each language directory has useful resources to help instrument applications written in those languages.

Some languages have a strong leaning toward frameworks, others are about patterns and other still about tooling.

These packs are intended to "meld in" with the common way of doing things in each language so that developer comfort is high and integration time and effort are minimal.

Community participation is welcome, just as is feedback of any kind.
